#Que 1 - Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any  algorithm – 

# a = [0,1,0,2,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,2,2,1,0]
# a.sort()
# print(a)



#Que 2 - Find the “Kth” max and min element of an array –
### no 


#merge sort 








#Que 3 - Move all the negative elements to one side of the array – 

#sirf sort krna hai 


#Que 4 - Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays. –


# arr1 = [1,6,9,10]
# arr2 = [10,11,90]

# union = arr1 + arr2

# inter = []
# for i in arr1:
#     if i in arr2:
#         inter.append(i)

# print(union)
# print(inter)



#Que 5 - Find Largest sum contiguous Subarray –

###

#Que 6 - Minimize the maximum difference between heights – 

















#Que  - Counting Inversion in Python

# a = [6,3,5,2,7]
# count = 0 
# for i in range(len(a)):
#     for j in range(len(a)):
#         if a[i]>a[j] and i<j:
#             count +=1
# print(count)
